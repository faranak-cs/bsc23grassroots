"""
Django Project Initialization Module

This '__init__.py' module serves as the initialization file for a Django project. It is intentionally left blank and exists to mark the directory as a Python package.

Usage:
- The '__init__.py' file is a standard component in a Python package or module.
- It signals that the containing directory should be treated as a package, allowing the use of relative imports and making it discoverable by Python.

Example:
- An empty '__init__.py' file is commonly found in Django project directories to indicate package status.

Note:
- Although this file is empty, it plays a crucial role in the organization and recognition of the associated Python package.
